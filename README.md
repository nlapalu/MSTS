# MSTS: MAINE-Seq Tool Suite

MSTS has been developed to analyse NGS data in the frame of MAINE-Seq experiments and to propose some utilities to draw graph and perform simple statistics on your data.

MSTS is developed by the BioinfoBIOGER plateform (N.Lapalu, A.Simon) at [INRA-BIOGER](http://www.versailles-grignon.inra.fr/bioger). Please do not hesitate to contact us (nlapalu at inra dot fr) if you have any comments or questions.
